      <h3>Konstantin Dauer - Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
      <p>
        I have 10 years of experience as a freelance event technology
        specialist. I worked all over europe, always focused to be up to date
        with the latest technologies in the field. I defined and created
        concepts, constructions and programs, drew technical plans with
        Vectorworks and AutoCAD. I planned, controlled and managed more than 100
        events per year with budgets over 150.000 â‚¬ and of various kind. Like
        concerts, festivals, fairs, conferences, conventions, product
        presentations, theater, movie and dance productions. In 2014 I started
        to study "event technology and management" at Beuth University of
        Applied Science.

        I really enjoyed my job but at some point I felt like a change of
        scenery. Since I had Computer Science as a major in my High School and I
        think that programming is the future I decided to do a Web Development
        Bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin and now I am a freshly trained Full Stack
        Web Developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I have been the connection between art and technology in the past and
        now I want to connect people and the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a freelancer I did a little bit of Design with InDesign, Illustrator
        and Photoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Ironhack I learned a lot of new Skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        nodeJS, MongoDB, Express, React JS, Bootstrap) and spend 400 h of
        coding. I learned to focus on clean code principles, design patterns and
        test driven development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My eye for detail, creative view of the world and my unagitated nature
        have given me with many satisfied clients. I look forward to speak with
        you about your projects and vision.
