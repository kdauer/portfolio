      <h3>Konstantin Dauer - Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
      <p>
        Gathering 10 years of experience as a freelance event technology
        specialist and working all over Europe, I was looking for a new
        Challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always focused to be up to date with the latest technologies in the
        field. I defined and created concepts, constructions and programs, drew
        technical plans with Vectorworks and AutoCAD. Over the years I planned,
        controlled and managed more than 100 events per year with budgets over
        150.000 â‚¬ and of various kind. Such as concerts, festivals, fairs,
        conferences, conventions, product presentations, theater, movie and
        dance productions. In 2014 I started to study the B. Eng. degree program
        "event technology and management" at Beuth University of Applied Science
        in Berlin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed my job but at some point I was looking for new
        challenges. Since I had Computer Science as a major in my High School
        and I am convinced that programming is the future I decided to do a Web
        Development Bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin and now I am a freshly trained
        Full Stack Web Developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past years I have been the connection between art and technology
        and consequently now I want to connect people and the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Ironhack I learned a broad range of new Skills (HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, nodeJS, MongoDB, Express, React JS, Bootstrap) and spend 400
        h of coding. I learned to focus on clean code principles, design
        patterns and test driven development.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a freelancer I did also creative work with InDesign, Illustrator and
        Photoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        My eye for detail, creative view of the world and my unagitated nature
        have given me many satisfied clients. I look forward to speak with you
        about your projects and vision.
